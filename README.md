# react_form_project  :----

The project is availabe on project_branch

So in this project what i am going to do is :- 

Create A form, having 4 inputs. FirstName, lastName, address, pincode, mobileNumber. Create a button to save this data in the state. And show it in a table below the form.

Create 4 buttons named ButtonA, ButtonB, ButtonC, ButtonD. Whenever you click on a button it should save the button name and the time when you clicked on button. Create a table and show the info.

Button Name       When I clicked

Button A           10:19:30

Button B           10:19:34

Button C           10:20:39

Button D           10:21:39

Button A           10:22:32

Button C           10:22:44



Create an input and a button named AddMore. When we click on the button it should add one more input on the page. And also collects data when we type on inputs.
